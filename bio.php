    <img class="biopic" src="./images/gillespie-conan-bio.jpg" title="Steve shaking hands with Conan O'Brien" /><p>A decade into his standup career, Steve Gillespie moved from Minneapolis to LA, recently made an appearance on Conan, and released his critically acclaimed second album, <span class="italic">Alive on State</span>, which reached #1 on the iTunes charts. Prior to that, this gentleman degenerate spent most of his life traveling the country regaling audiences with his delightful self-destruction.
</p>

    <p>Gillespie’s act is a slaphappy balance of aggression and absurdity, coupled with a delightfully pushy persona and coarse yet effective word choice. His hilarious self&ndash;
flagellation and blistering social commentary has also earned him spots on Fox’s Laughs as well as the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and the Boston Comedy Festival. He was a finalist in CMT’s Next Big Comic, a runner up for Best of the Midwest at Gilda’s Laughfest, and his debut album Stever Fever from Rooftop Comedy was named a top&ndash;
10 comedy album of the year by ComedyReviews.com.</p>

    <p class="bottom">Gillespie has also had the pleasure of sharing the biggest stages with some of the best comics in the country, including opening appearances for Dave Attell, Jim Breuer, Tom Segura, Kyle Kinnane, Tom Green, Harland Williams, Doug Benson, Emo Phillips, and Gilbert Gottfried.</p><img class="biopic-right" src="./images/cropped-gillespie-bio.jpg" title="Steve Gilesspie performing on Conan O'Brien" />
